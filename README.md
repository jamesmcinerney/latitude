Retrieve data from Google Latitude API.

I wrote this code because I wanted a way to download the data from Google Latitude that I had been collecting with my smartphone. This is useful for research into location behaviour in daily life.

In order to make this work, you need to **create your own project in Google API manager**. Enable OAuth2.0. When you have the new project, copy-paste the Client ID and Client Secret into the top of the python code here, and then run. Once authenticated by the user, you will then be able to retrieve all the data.
